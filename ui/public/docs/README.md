## Key Concepts

### Convention over Configuration
Construct follows established patterns to reduce boilerplate code. File-based routing, auto-imports, and intelligent defaults mean you can focus on building features.

### Type Safety
End-to-end TypeScript support ensures your frontend and backend stay in sync as your application evolves.

### Modern Development Experience
Hot reload, auto-completion, and integrated tooling provide a fast and enjoyable development cycle.
